[IMU]
# Serial port for the IMU (e.g., /dev/ttyACM0 on Linux, COM3 on Windows)
port = /dev/ttyACM0
baud_rate = 115200

[LiDAR]
# Serial port for the LiDAR (e.g., /dev/ttyUSB0 on Linux, COM4 on Windows)
port = /dev/ttyUSB0
baud_rate = 230400
# Set 'enabled' to false if LiDAR is not connected or shouldn't be used
enabled = true

[Calibration]
# Delay before starting still calibration (gravity/gyro)

# Delay before prompting user for motion calibration (magnetometer)
rotation_delay_seconds = 10
# Duration to search for LiDAR packets during clock sync (optional, defaults in API)
# lidar_sync_duration_s = 0.2
